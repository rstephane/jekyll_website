# Work in progress

Three variants are considered, but currently we focus on the one closest to the requirement of medical staff.


## Recovid-MD - close to a medical device grade ventilator - In french
(updated on the 1st of April 2020)

## Recovid-MD - close to a medical device grade ventilator - In English
This is our current target (in english)

## Recovid-simple

## Recovid-DIY

It is not clear if this type of device is of any use in a Hospital.
No sensors, so no clinically usable data.

## Scrap-made presure valves (APL, PEEP)

Material: aquarium tube 4mm internal / 6mm external
Section not enough enough I would have to double the diameter
2 or 4 non-return valve:

pipe 4/6mm :

possibility of using diffusers in a volume of water to filter the exhaled air:

ISSUE:
* the rectangular volumes prevent the water used for pressure control from leaving the system I still don't know how to make them.
* the system is not adjustable in pressure ... except to put several PEP control system in parallel with small valves: not terrible

## Other considerations
